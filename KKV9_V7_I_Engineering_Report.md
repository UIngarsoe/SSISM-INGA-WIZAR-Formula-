KKV9 Pyin Nyarshi V7 \mathcal{I} Engineering Report
Executive Summary: The \mathbf{V7 \mathcal{I}} Computational Wisdom Leap
This report formalizes the mathematical and architectural transition from the Master V6 Deterministic Intervention Engine to the V7 \mathcal{I} (Integrated) core logic, which powers the proprietary KKV9 Pyin Nyarshi application.
The upgrade integrates the Inga Wizar (IW) Formula—which is freely provided as a foundational mathematical framework—with the proprietary Kat-Kin Logic Gate (\mathbf{V}_{\mathcal{K}}). This creates a computational architecture that not only ensures ethical containment but also optimizes for Skillful Uptake (\mathbf{A}) and performs Iterative Refinement (\mathbf{T}_{\text{refined}}) based on real-world outcomes.
