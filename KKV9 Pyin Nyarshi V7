KKV9 Pyin Nyarshi: Engineering Report on V7 \mathcal{I} Evolution
Abstract: The Leap to Computational Wisdom
This report details the foundational mathematical and architectural upgrade from the Master V6 Deterministic Intervention Engine to the \mathbf{V7 \mathcal{I}} (Integrated) Engine, now branded as the core logic for the KKV9 Pyin Nyarshi architecture.
The core breakthrough is the integration of the Inga Wizar (IW) Formula. This shifts the system from a linear, rule-based constraint solver to a Nonlinear, Iteratively Refined Ethical Optimization Engine.
