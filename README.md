# Inga Wizar Formula — Inga Wizar Engine Project

A modular, script-based computation engine that models Perception Truth (T), Skillful Uptake (A), Contextual Safeguards, and Iterative Refinement (T_refined). Inspired by the Inga Wizar philosophy, this engine supports reproducible experimentation, education, and integration into AI ethics workflows and cognitive-modeling research.

## Overview

The Inga Wizar Formula converts qualitative ethical and epistemic insights into a transparent computational framework.  
The engine incorporates core concepts such as Perception Truth (T), Skillful Uptake (A), Contextual Penalty, and Iterative Refinement (T_refined).  
Its modular design facilitates research, pedagogy, and practical integration for ethical AI and cognitive modeling.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or newer  
- Minimal dependencies: `numpy` (optional `pandas` for extended I/O)

### Installation

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run a Baseline Experiment

```
python run_experiment.py config_example.json --steps 50
python run_experiment.py config_example.json --steps 50 --nonlinear
```

### Output

You will see per-step outputs for T, A, ContextPenalty, F, E, and T_refined with a feedback loop updating T dynamically.  
Logs can be extended to CSV/JSON using built-in IO utilities.

## Features

- Supports linear and configurable nonlinear modes (tanh and sigmoid)  
- Config-driven experiments for parameter sweeps  
- Command-line interface for reproducible workflows  
- Modular and extensible for integration with AI ethics pipelines and educational tools

## Project Structure

- `agghivija_engine.py` — Core engine API with mathematical functions  
- `run_experiment.py` — CLI tool to run simulations via config files  
- `config_example.json` — Example configuration parameters  
- `tests/` — Unit tests for core functionality  
- `requirements.txt` — External dependencies  
- `LICENSE` — Project License  
- `Notebooks/` — Optional demonstration notebooks  
- `README.md` — This document  

---

## Configuration and Usage

Edit or create config JSON files to tune parameters such as:  
- Inputs: S (data quality), C (context clarity), R (reflective calibration), I (intention integrity), E_const (ethical safeguards), P (contextual preconditions)  
- Weights: α (perception), β (uptake), γ (action efficacy), κ (scaling), η (context modulation)  
- Refinement: Learning rate, feedback quality  
- Enable nonlinear mode by adding `--nonlinear` in CLI commands  

---

## API Reference

Core engine functions:  
- `compute_T(S, C, R, alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, nonlinear=False)`  
- `compute_A(T, I, E_const, beta1, beta2, beta3, nonlinear=False, threshold=0)`  
- `compute_ContextPenalty(C)`  
- `compute_F(A, ContextPenalty, gamma1, gamma2)`  
- `compute_E(F, etaP, kappa)`  
- `update_T(T, DesiredTruth, learning_rate, FeedbackQuality)`  
- `run_single_step(params, nonlinear=False)`  

Detailed docstrings are in the codebase (`agghivija_engine.py`).

---

## Nonlinear Modes

- Perception Truth uses hyperbolic tangent:  
  \( T_{\text{nonlinear}} = \tanh(\alpha_1 S + \alpha_2 C + \alpha_3 R) \)  
- Skillful Uptake uses sigmoid:  
  \( A_{\text{nonlinear}} = \sigma(\beta_1 T + \beta_2 I + \beta_3 E - \theta) \)  
- Provide expressive extension and alignment with cognitive modeling.

---

## Testing

- Unit tests cover linear and nonlinear computations, feedback loop stability.  
- Run tests using:  

```
python -m pytest
```
